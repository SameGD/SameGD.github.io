**Introduction**

Oh boy watching movies, I can do this one! Wait a second, now that I think about it, watching movies requires sitting still for about an hour and a half, and paying sole attention to the movie. Maybe this one will be harder than I thought. Anyway, I guess I should be introducing what Movies are, but honestly how the hell did you even get to this website if you didn't already know? I refuse to believe there's someone who knows how to use the internet and doesn't know what movies are, so I'll spare you the laborious details.

Instead, I'm going to talk about my own personal feelings regarding movies. In general, I'm not that much of a movie fan. I feel like TV Shows are better the better medium for storytelling, since they actually have the time to properly show and explore the world they're presenting; and in general, both Movies and TV Shows are easily eclipsed by Books. That being said, I don't think that all movies are terrible, I just think they're harder to do right.

In my opinion, a movie should be a short-form, self-contained story, that focuses heavily on cinematography and sound. So let's look at each of these criteria, starting with short-form. I believe that a good movie should lean into the fact that it has a limited amount of time to show its story, and should aggressively cut unnecessary content. Every scene should have a purpose, and there shouldn't be any content that you could look back on and say "this could have been cut without affecting the rest of the story".

By self-contained, I mean that the movie should be able to completely stand on its own, without the need for sequels and/or deleted scenes to tie off the loose ends of the story. In most cases, I think having a sequel defeats the purpose of what Movies are; if your story was too big to be contained in two hours, then you should have made a TV Series instead. I guess in general, I feel like a movie should leave you feeling like it was 'just enough', it shouldn't overstay its welcome and drag on for 3 hours, nor should it end abruptly without tying off all the loose ends.

And finally, I believe that movies should focus on cinematography and sound. To make up for the lack of time, what a good movie should do is absolutely pack each scene with content. Since you can hardly layer multiple scenes on top of each other and expect the viewer to understand what's happening, you instead have to use cinematography to add extra information to each scene. Everything, from the angle of the shot, to the hue and vibrance of the light used in each scene, can and should be used to convey information that the content of the scene alone cannot. And extending this, a movie is nothing without a good audio score. The reason why music sounds good is that it hacks the emotional processing parts of our brains, forcing us to feel emotions that we otherwise wouldn't have. A good score can absolutely carry a movie, and heck, even reality TV shows utilise it to great effect (without poppy music and sound effects, most Australian / American reality shows would be near unwatchable). You could make a movie that's almost completely devoid of content, with the absolute barest of plots, and turn it into a masterpiece using only a good score and good camerawork. In fact, they did do that, it's called [The Secret Life of Walter Mitty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/), and it's fantastic.

A movie that has all of these aspects can be great, but unfortunately they're few and far between.

**Terms of Engagement**

I haven't watched that many movies in my life, and I've actually managed to completely avoid watching the [top 9 rated movies on IMBD](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/) (I have seen The Shawshank Redemption, which is #1). So, to consider this hobby completed, I want to have watched the Top 2 - 11 movies on this list, which are:

1. ~~The Shawshank Redemption~~
2. The Godfather
3. The Godfather: Part II
4. The Dark Knight
5. 12 Angry Men
6. Schindler's List
7. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
8. Pulp Fiction
9. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
10. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
11. Fight Club

And write a breif review of each, as well as my score out of 10 for it. I am not looking forward to watching Lord of the Rings, but I'll power through regardless. Anyway, onto being a Couch Potato I go!
