    <p>Completion Requirements</p>

    <p>I haven't watched that many movies in my life, and I've actually managed to completely avoid watching the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/">top 9 rated movies on IMBD</a> (I've seen The Shawshank Redemption). So, to consider this hobby completed, I want to have watched the Top 2 - 11 movies on this list, which are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The Shawshank Redemption</li>
      <li>The Godfather</li>
      <li>The Godfather: Part II</li>
      <li>The Dark Knight</li>
      <li>12 Angry Men</li>
      <li>Schindler's List</li>
      <li>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</li>
      <li>Pulp Fiction</li>
      <li>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</li>
      <li>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</li>
      <li>Fight Club</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And write a breif review of each, as well as my score out of 10 for it. I am not looking forward to watching Lord of the Rings, but I'll power through regardless. Anyway, onto being a Couch Potato I go!</p>
