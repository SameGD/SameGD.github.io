      <p>Completion Requirements</p>

      <p>So obviously I could completely cheese this hobby and just listen to one of the many websites online for a few minutes, but I don’t think that’s in the spirit of this project. To consider this hobby completed, I want to have completed the three following projects:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make / setup a shortwave receiver, to satisfy the hardware component of this hobby.</li>
        <li>Make a website to interface with this receiver and allow the shortwave radio to be listened to online, to satisfy the software component of this hobby.</li>
        <li>Write 5 reviews of different radio stations or broadcasts that I’ve listened to using the website and equipment I’ve setup.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>And bingo-bango, just like that I’ll be SWLing with the cool cats.</p>
