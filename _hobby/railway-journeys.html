      <p>So there's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/42l1q3/some_mates_posted_this_on_facebook_3_days_17/">this post</a> on Reddit that I actually like (I know, very cringe), that has the title:</p>
      <br>
      <p>"3 days, 17 lines and 218 stations later the quest to reach every station in Melbourne is complete. <b>If you can't travel the world, travel the metro</b>."</p>
      <br>
      <p>And since I love plagiarising, I think I'm going to do something similar. Specifically, I'm going to visit every train station on the Melbourne Metro, and take a picture outside every station to put on this page.</p>
