      <p>Completion Requirements</p>

      <p>To consider Geocaching as completed for this project (although realistically I’ll never actually find all the caches, there’s literally millions of them worldwide), I want to have done the following tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Integrate my Geocaching profile onto this page (to show finds and such).</li>
        <li>Find all the caches from within at least a 10km radius from where I live; and</li>
        <li>Place a sticker on each of these caches (uhhh long story why).</li>
      </ol>
