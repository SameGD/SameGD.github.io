**Introduction**

---

Shortwave Listening, or SWLing as the cool kids call it, is the hobby of listening to long-distance radio broadcasts on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. As far as I can tell, this hobby has two major components: the technical side, which involves setting up the equipment and software necessary to receive and listen to these signals; and the entertainment side, which involves actually listening to these broadcasts to immerse yourself in the wide range cultures and programming that are available on these frequencies.

(Is this really what I’m going with for the name of this section?)

So obviously I could completely cheese this hobby and just listen to one of the many websites online for a few minutes, but I don’t think that’s in the spirit of this project. To consider this hobby completed, I want to have completed the three following projects:

1. Make / setup a shortwave receiver, to satisfy the hardware component of this hobby.
2. Make a website to interface with this receiver and allow the shortwave radio to be listened to online, to satisfy the software component of this hobby.
3. Write 5 reviews of different radio stations or broadcasts that I’ve listened to using the website and equipment I’ve setup.

And bingo-bango, just like that I’ll be SWLing with the cool cats.
