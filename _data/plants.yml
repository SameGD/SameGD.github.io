- name: "Benjamin"
  species: "Crassula Ovata?"
  description: "Benjamin was my first plant, that I got after an awful trip to Ikea. He's still small, but he's really improved from when I got him (and from that two month period where I accidentally underwatered him)."

- name: "Benju"
  species: "Crassula Ovata?"
  description: "Benju (or Benjamin Junior) was this random cutting I found in Benjamin's pot. He was in pretty bad condition when I first repotted him, but he's doing really well now!"

- name: "Tyler"
  species: "Aeonium Haworthii?"
  description: "Tyler was my second plant, that I got from a farmers market. He used to be kept in my room, but after he was caught harboring a praying mantis I banished him to decking (along with all the other plants)."

- name: "Jamie"
  species: "Crassula Rupestris?"
  description: "Jamie was a Christmas gift from my sister, and I have no idea how they're progressing. What I can safely say is that they're either doing better or worse from when I got them."

- name: "Steven"
  species: "Callisia Repens?"
  description: "Steven was also a Christmas gift from my sister, so Jamie and him are essentially siblings. Steven was named after Steven Universe, because you know, they're both pink. I know, I'm a creative genius, no need to praise me."

- name: "Izzy"
  species: "Crassula Arborescens?"
  description: "I found Izzy in the backyard in the bowl she's currently in, except there were only rocks and no soil inside it. After replanting her, I think she's starting to do ok again, although I have no idea how to check if that's true."

- name: "Theo"
  species: "Crassula Ovata?"
  description: "Theo was in the same bowl as Izzy, but he was put in one of my sisters pottery attempts instead. I think he's actually doing quite well, he's definitely less shriveled than when I found him."

- name: "Penny"
  species: "Portulacaria Afra?"
  description: "Penny used to belong to my parents, and was outside our house for years before I repotted her. Apparently you put this type of plant at the front of your door, and it brings the house money (which is why I named her Penny). No one watered her for years, but she's on the mend! She's also on the mend from the chemical burns I accidentally gave her trying to get rid of some pests."

- name: "George"
  species: "?"
  description: "I found George at Coles, and after a few weeks of seeing him every time I went shopping, my willpower was worn down and I finally bought him."

- name: "Cookie"
  species: "Chlorophytum Comosum"
  description: "This was my sisters plant, but she gave it to me after months of not growing. I'm not really sure what to do with her, she has an infestation of these small insects who are apparently resistant to all my poisons and she's not really growing. She's named also named after my Sister."
