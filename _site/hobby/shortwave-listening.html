      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Shortwave Listening, or SWLing as the cool kids call it, is the hobby of listening to long-distance radio broadcasts on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. As far as I can tell, this hobby has two major components: the technical side, which involves setting up the equipment and software necessary to receive and listen to these signals; and the entertainment side, which involves actually listening to these broadcasts to immerse yourself in the wide range cultures and programming that are available on these frequencies.</p>

<p><strong>Terms of Engagement</strong></p>

<p>(Is this really what I’m going with for the name of this section?)</p>

<p>So obviously I could completely cheese this hobby and just listen to one of the many websites online for a few minutes, but I don’t think that’s in the spirit of this project. To consider this hobby completed, I want to have completed the three following projects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make / setup a shortwave receiver, to satisfy the hardware component of this hobby.</li>
  <li>Make a website to interface with this receiver and allow the shortwave radio to be listened to online, to satisfy the software component of this hobby.</li>
  <li>Write 5 reviews of different radio stations or broadcasts that I’ve listened to using the website and equipment I’ve setup.</li>
</ol>

<p>And bingo-bango, just like that I’ll be SWLing with the cool cats.</p>
