Blog Test 4
{: .title}

Revenge of the blog test
{: .subtitle}

This is a test to see if I can use google docs to write the content for my websites, since that will be way easier than doing it inside brackets. **This should be bold.** _This should be in italics._ <sup>This should be superscript.</sup> <sub>This should be subscript. </sub>



*   This should be dot point 1
*   This should be dot point 2
*   This should be dot point 3

~~This should be strikethroughed. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">This should be underlined and strikethroughed.</span>~~

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">This should be underlined</span>



1. This should be numbered 1
2. This should be numbered 2

Well dope, looks like I'm using docs to write the site content! Oh god this is the first post on this blog that actually has any sort of content. Is this a sign of things to come?
