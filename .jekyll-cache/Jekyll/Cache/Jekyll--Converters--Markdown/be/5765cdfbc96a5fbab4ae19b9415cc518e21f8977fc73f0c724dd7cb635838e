I"ì<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Oh boy watching movies, I can do this one! Wait a second, watching movies requires sitting still for about an hour and a half, and paying sole attention to the movie. Maybe this one will be harder than I thought.</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess I should be introducing what Movies are, but honestly how the hell did you even get to this website if you donâ€™t already know? I refuse to believe thereâ€™s someone who knows how to use the internet and doesnâ€™t know what movies are, so Iâ€™ll spare you the laborious details.</p>

<p>Instead, Iâ€™m going to talk about my own personal feelings regarding movies. In general, Iâ€™m not that much of a movie fan. I feel like TV shows are better the better medium for storytelling, since they actually have the time to properly show and explore the world theyâ€™re presenting; and Books are just better in general for telling stories, since they can actually convey what the protagonist is thinking (I know that )</p>
