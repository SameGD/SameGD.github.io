I"F	<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Oh boy watching movies, I can do this one! Wait a second, now that I think about it, watching movies requires sitting still for about an hour and a half, and paying sole attention to the movie. Maybe this one will be harder than I thought.</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess I should be introducing what Movies are, but honestly how the hell did you even get to this website if you didn’t already know? I refuse to believe there’s someone who knows how to use the internet and doesn’t know what movies are, so I’ll spare you the laborious details.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to talk about my own personal feelings regarding movies. In general, I’m not that much of a movie fan. I feel like TV Shows are better the better medium for storytelling, since they actually have the time to properly show and explore the world they’re presenting; and in general, both Movies and TV Shows are easily eclipsed by Books. That being said, I don’t think that all movies are terrible, I just think they’re harder to do right.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a movie should be a short-form, self-contained story, that focuses heavily on cinematography and sound. So let’s look at each of these criteria, starting with short-form. I believe that a good movie should lean into the fact that it has a limited amount of time to show its story, and should aggressively cut unnecessary content. Every scene should have a purpose, and there shouldn’t be any content that you could look back on and say “this could have been cut without affecting the rest of the story”.</p>

<p>By self-contained, I mean that the movie should be able to completely stand on its own, without the need for sequels and/or deleted scenes to tie off the loose ends of the story. In most cases, I think having a sequel defeats the purpose of what Movies are; if your story was too big to be contained in two hours, then you should have made a TV Series instead. I guess in general, I feel like a movie should leave you feeling like it was ‘just enough’, it shouldn’t overstay its welcome and drag on for 3 hours, nor should it end abruptly without tying off all the loose ends.</p>

<p>And finally, I believe that movies should focus on cinematography and sound. What a movie has going for it is that it can be absolutely loaded with content, each scene</p>
