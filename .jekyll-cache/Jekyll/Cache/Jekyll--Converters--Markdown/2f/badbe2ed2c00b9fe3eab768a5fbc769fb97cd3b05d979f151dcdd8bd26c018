I"{<p>Light therapy is an up-and-coming treatment for a variety of mental health issues, namely depression (especially Seasonal Affective Disorder) and sleep-phase disorders. The dysregulation of the body’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm">circadian rhythm</a> (sleep cycle) has been implicated in these issues, so light therapy aims to regulate this janked up rhythm by mimicking the light of the sun. To do this, light therapy involves the use of light boxes (though there are also light glasses, lamps and dawn simulators, which I won’t go into now), which are essentially just boxes with really bright lights inside them. For treatment, you turn the box on in the morning for thirtyish minutes (it differs on how bright the light is, and how much light you want), and bathe in its light (i.e. go on your phone while facing the general direction of the box).</p>
