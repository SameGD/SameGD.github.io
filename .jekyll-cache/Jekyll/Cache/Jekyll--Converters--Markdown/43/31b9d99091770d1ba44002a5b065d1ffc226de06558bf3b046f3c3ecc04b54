I"¤<p>With lockdown finally coming to a close, and the horrors of zoom university almost in the past, Iâ€™ve been trying to think of some fun activities to do over summer. Now, while I already have a bunch of ideas of varying quality and feasibility, the one I want to focus on in this post is an idea for a systemised Water Balloon fight. Thatâ€™s right, itâ€™s time for some more Primary School Sam wish fulfillment!</p>
