I"˜<p>Today, I bring you a tale of woe; a story punctuated by urban decay, poor mapping data, and the hubris of a writer. This is a story of the many abandoned schools in Victoria, and my efforts to determine whether theyâ€™ve withstood the trials of time, or fallen under its crushing weight. The bards might not sing of what transpires within these words, but nonetheless itâ€™s a tale that must be told.</p>
