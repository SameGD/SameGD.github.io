<p>Geocaching is a super fun hobby which Iâ€™ve already tried, but of course Iâ€™m bound by the rules of Graphics Demo to do a project for it. <a href="https://www.geocaching.com">Geocaching</a> is essentially a global treasure hunt, where people have hidden containers (or caches if you will), that will normally contain some form of logbook, and occasionally random trinkets and treasures. After hiding their container, theyâ€™ll log the GPS coordinates of its location on one of the various geocaching websites, where theyâ€™ll often give cryptic clues about the location of the container, as well as a detailed history about the cache or surrounding area. As a finder, youâ€™ll have access to a map showing all the different types of caches in your area (with even more available if you purchase premium), where you can get their locations, track them down, and log your find.</p>

<p>While the material rewards for finding a cache are slim-to-none, geocaching is all about the glory of the find; and the journey definitely matters more than the destination in most cases. Hiders have absolutely no monetary incentive to hide their caches, so instead, theyâ€™re paid in stories of peopleâ€™s experiences finding their cache (itâ€™s considered poor etiquette to not leave a comment after a find).</p>

<p>Geocaching to me, feels like an exemplification of the ideals of whimsy and adventure, and I <em>absolutely</em> adore it. When I was growing up, I always used to imagine the world as being magical, full of treasures and secrets that were just waiting for me to find. Of course, as I grew up, I discovered that the world isnâ€™t so magical; that the tree I walk past everyday doesnâ€™t have a portal to another world; that the gate on the sidewalk isnâ€™t a secret passage and is in fact, just a gate. And honestly, it was kind of depressing to realise that the world was so much smaller than I thought it was when I was younger. I feel like the people in the Geocaching community were a bit like me as a kid, but when faced with a world dwindling of magic, they decided to fight against it and make their own.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no point to Geocaching, no reason to seek out a cache apart from your own sense of curiosity and adventure. You could find no caches, or you could find a thousand of them, and honestly, nothing would change.</p>

<p>But I think thatâ€™s beside the point.</p>

<p>With Geocaching, there could be a cache hidden absolutely anywhere, in that park near where you live, or even inside the place where you work. And because of that, Geocaching makes the world feel a little more mysterious, a little more like how I thought it was as a kid, and I think thatâ€™s worth a pretty damn lot.</p>

<p><strong>Terms of Engagement</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>To consider Geocaching as completed for this project (although realistically Iâ€™ll never actually find all the caches, thereâ€™s literally millions of them worldwide), I want to have done the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Integrate my Geocaching profile onto this page (to show finds and such).</li>
  <li>Find all the caches from within at least a 10km radius from where I live; and</li>
  <li>Place a sticker on each of these caches (uhhh long story why).</li>
</ol>

<p>And with that, itâ€™s Geocaching time! Hope I donâ€™t get pulled over by the police again!</p>
