<p>Capricorn International Resort is one of Queenslands (apparently) many abandoned resorts. This one is located in Yeppoon, and has the largest outdoor swimming pool in the southern hemisphere. Noteably, the resort had a bomb explode in it during construction, causing millions of dollars of damage and delaying its completion. Both the government and the group that made the resort swore to reopen the resort in 2017 (they must love swimming pools), but as of the end of 2021, no progress has been made. But hey, at least the Japanese resteraunt is still open inside it.</p>
